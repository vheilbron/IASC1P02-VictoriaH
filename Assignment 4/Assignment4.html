	<h3> Hi, my name is Victoria and I am in the Concurrent Program at Brock University
	for Intermediate/ Senior and majoring in French and minoring in Geography. As one of my
electives for first year, I chose this class. When reading the class description, I was
excited to start because I was already heavily interested in computers and technology and
when selecting this course, I knew I would need to put a lot of effort to succeed and I
believe that I have done so.  </h3>
<h3>When Assignment 4 was posted, it took me a while to figure out what I wanted my
final website to be. Since I have always had an interest in blogs and peoples' lifestyles,
designing my own "blog" seemed right up my alley. </h3>
<h3>To make this more "blog like" I will let you know a few things about me. I am born in May, so
	I'm a Taurus and I am <span id="ItalicWord"> very </span> stubborn. I love puppies over kittens,
	and I would rather stay in with friends rather than go out and party. Chocolate over candy anyday.</h3>
